=head1 NAME

Exobrain::Message

=head1 VERSION

version 0.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Top-level I<role> for all exobrain messages.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 payload

    payload size => ( isa => 'Int' );

Convenience method which sets the 'payload' trait on an attribute,
as well as marking it as 'ro' and required by default (these
can be overridden).

=head2 namespace

    my $namespace = $message->namespace;

Provides the namespace of the message type in question. By default
this is the class name with the C<Exobrain> prefix stripped,
but individual message classes are free to define their own namespaces.

=head2 data

    my $data = $message->data;

Messages automatically create a data method (needed for transmitting
over the exobrain bus) by tallying payload attributes.

=head2 send_msg($socket?)

Sends the message across the exobrain bus. If no socket is provided,
the one from the exobrain object (if we were built with one) is used.

=head2 dump()

    my $pkt_debug = $msg->dump;

Provides a string containing a dump of universal packet attributes.
Intended for debugging.
